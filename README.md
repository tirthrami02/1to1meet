# 1to1meet

This project called "MyMeet".
It is one to one calling project.
You can create different rooms for 2 people.
Where you have video calling feature, copy that roomID feature and end call feature.
You also mute your mic and turned off your camera.

Here, I have used Agora WEBRTC API to build this project.
This is home page:

When mic or camera is off then that button shows black color.
Red color button is for ending your call.

Also there is small window at upper left corner to watch 2nd person's face.

This is the meeting window:
